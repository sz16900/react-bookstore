In this project, we are going to make a React-Redux bookstore application to demonstrate mastery of building React components by following step-by-step guidelines from a fake company based in "Germany". Awesomized with pure CSS. This project is completed by Seth Zea and Shubbham Raj, in partial requirements of the Microverse cirriculum.
